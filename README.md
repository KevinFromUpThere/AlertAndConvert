# AlertAndConvert

This is a program written a long time ago to manage video downloads back when apple devices were strict about what formats they could watch.

The software would send you a message (tweet) when a new file appeared, then start converting it into an apple friendly format, and tweet out it's progress along the way.

Twitter has since changed it's API so the "Alert" part would no longer work.
