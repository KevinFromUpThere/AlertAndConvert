# AlertAndConvert

This is a program written a long time ago to manage video downloads back when apple devices were strict about what formats they could watch.

The software would send you a message (tweet) when a new file appeared, then start converting it into an apple friendly format, and tweet out it's progress along the way.  Finally it would add the file to iTunes and to a playlist that you would presumably have set to sync with your device.

Twitter has since changed it's API so the "Alert" part would no longer work.

Requirements: HandbrakeCLI.exe (command line interface)
